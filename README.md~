Catkin workspace containing data about Kuka KR5 ARC robot and path planning using DESCARTES (ROS).

Before building you need to run the moveit setup assistant again.
Before you can run the moveit setup assisten you need the kuka_description package.

Use
`catkin_make --pkg kuka_description`
to avoid building the other packages already and then
`source devel/setup.bash`
as always.
